[12/12/19 4:26 PM] Britney Brown: Same I didn't get any yet either üòï

[12/12/19 4:28 PM] Nicole Aquino: I got one and steph had an extra, so she gave me that 

[12/12/19 4:29 PM] Stephanie Shirey: I bought a box of 30 from Costco. It seems about half the box was stolen or is otherwise missing since we should have had 8 extra and are now at least four short.  

[12/12/19 4:30 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Student wondering the building?  Custodian or other staff who thought they were up for grabs?!?

[12/12/19 4:30 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Not sure - but I put 29 out on the table and now we don't have enough 

[12/12/19 4:31 PM] Britney Brown: Kathy I had a soccer player come by saying she left her phone on your room, I went in with her and she found it, just so you don't think a custodian took it üëçüòä

[12/12/19 4:35 PM] Judy Rehburg: I got my two for mine, there were three left.

[12/12/19 5:09 PM] Kathryn Oberle: That's not good!   I can pick up some more tomorrow morning.  How many are needed?

[12/12/19 5:12 PM] Addy Tang: I need 2 and Brit needs 2 also

[12/12/19 5:40 PM] Judy Rehburg: Wow! That's like 13 missing! 

[12/12/19 8:00 PM] Judy Rehburg: 30-21 so 9 leftovers. 2 for Brit, 2 for Addy, and 1 for Nicole. Steph took one for herself since she bought them, so 13.

[12/12/19 8:00 PM] Kathryn Oberle: 13?!?!

[12/12/19 8:00 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Yeah - almost half the box went MIA.  We just need to purchase 4 to cover Brit and Addie, tho.

[12/12/19 8:13 PM] Judy Rehburg: All in the last day. I think they were there yesterday 

[12/14/19 12:12 PM] Leilani Green: What kind of stocking stuffers should I be looking for? And what day are we bringing the secret Santa gifts?

[12/14/19 1:02 PM] Nicole Aquino: Why 12? I thought it was 2-3 per person and aren't there 10 of us? 

[12/14/19 1:32 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Audra is joining us on stockings so we need 11.  

[12/14/19 1:37 PM] Nicole Aquino: Ok thank you 

[12/17/19 3:29 PM] Britney Brown: Random question:

[1/19/20 10:19 AM] Judy Rehburg: Anybody have galvanometers I can borrow this week? I need about 4

[1/19/20 10:23 AM] Jessica Dutton: Yep.

[1/19/20 10:24 AM] Judy Rehburg: Sweet! Can I pick them up today or tomorrow? I want to set up and try out a new lab. 

[1/19/20 10:26 AM] Jessica Dutton: Store room. Fund the cabinet on my side labeled electricity and magnetism. They SHOULD be in there. It's a cabinet that hasn't been organized yet...

[1/19/20 10:26 AM] Judy Rehburg: Is there a code to get into your building?

[1/19/20 10:45 AM] Jessica Dutton: Nope

[1/19/20 10:54 AM] Judy Rehburg: Great, thanks!

[1/19/20 12:24 PM] Judy Rehburg: I got this to work!

[1/19/20 12:25 PM] Jessica Dutton: No. I was there yesterday. They all kind of look the same, but a little bigger and labeled galvanometer

[1/19/20 12:25 PM] Jessica Dutton: Is it reading 1.5?

[1/19/20 12:26 PM] Judy Rehburg: Yes. Basically I'm just trying to show that things can make a current and some currents are stronger than others. Do I want a multimeter for that?

[1/19/20 12:27 PM] Jessica Dutton: The Ammeter measures current. Looks the same, but had an A instead of a V. A multimeter would work too. 

[1/19/20 12:28 PM] Judy Rehburg: Ah! Two of them have A's, not V's. That's why they didn't work! I tried the V on the different experiments and it worked!

[1/19/20 12:29 PM] Jessica Dutton: So, youy are measuring voltage, not current. They also have to be hooked up into the circuit differently, or you'll burn them out. 

[1/19/20 12:30 PM] Judy Rehburg: Ok, thanks for your help!

[1/20/20 10:10 AM] Leilani Green: Do our room keys work on the front office? Is there going to be an alarm?

[1/20/20 10:11 AM] Stephanie Shirey: Nope - you don't have keys to the front office.  Just the library copiers and our building

[1/27/20 6:26 PM] Judy Rehburg: Zach, how you doing?

[1/27/20 7:31 PM] Me: Still feeling pretty crappy, I've been floating in and out of consciousness for most of the day.

I have the flu so I got a prescription for Tamiflu and ibuprofen. The Dr recommended that I stay home till Thursday unless I feel healthy enough for Wednesday. Overall, I'm very thankful this appears to be the head/body flu vs the stomach flu.

[1/27/20 7:32 PM] Judy Rehburg: Thankful indeed! Get better, but thank you for keeping your germs at home!

[1/28/20 7:46 PM] Judy Rehburg: Zach update? How you doing? Feeling any better?

[1/28/20 7:56 PM] Me: Meds are helping to a degree but I still feel messed up and I can't quite think straight. I'm taking one more day to try and end this thing.

[1/28/20 7:59 PM] Judy Rehburg: Good. Sleep all day, feel better

[1/28/20 8:19 PM] Nicole Aquino: Feel better and rest!

[1/28/20 9:20 PM] Nicole Aquino: Zach, you could have just sent it to one of us to copy! I would have done it for you 

[1/28/20 9:57 PM] Me: Thanks for the offer. I decided to take another sick day late this afternoon when my symptoms hadn't improved. I didn't want to ask any of you to come in before zero period to make sure they had materials.

[1/29/20 5:46 PM] Judy Rehburg: Zach, how ya doing? And Kathy, so we have science night at Golden tomorrow?

[1/29/20 6:50 PM] Me: Still not 100% but my fever broke so I'm gonna come back tomorrow. 

In other news, I'm finally reading ball the documentation for my prescribed meds. The most common side effects are "nausea, vomiting, headache and pain"..... This is to treat the flu.

[2/9/20 1:11 PM] Britney Brown: Hey guys.... ummm was anyone in my room this weekend? Or maybe students passing thru during sci oly time? Chewies cage was forced open the wrong way and he is gone... also things in he sci oly area were weirdly on when I got here, I'm kinda bummed about chewie, he will be the second pet to just go missing from my room this year üòï

[2/9/20 1:12 PM] Judy Rehburg: Oh no! SO was in the back yesterday, I really hope it wasn't them. You need help looking for him?

[2/9/20 1:13 PM] Nicole Aquino: Oh no! That's awful 

[2/9/20 1:13 PM] Jessica Dutton: Nobody was near your room yesterday.  Bryan and I were the last ones out, and had turned everything off and locked up. Sorry about Chewie. 

[2/9/20 1:13 PM] Britney Brown: Finn and I are looking all over the sci building right now, so far no luck there's only one place left he could be but there's no way he's coming out if he's there üòï

[2/9/20 2:41 PM] Nicole Aquino: Maybe he'll come to my room because he smells my girls? And we can get him back

[2/9/20 2:42 PM] Britney Brown: Liked ‚ÄúMaybe he'll come to my room because he smells my girls? And we can get him back‚Äù

[2/10/20 11:15 AM] Judy Rehburg: I walked the science building just now, no sign. I'm keeping my eye out. Maybe send an email to the staff to see if they hear anything from the kids about taking him?

[3/2/20 3:35 PM] Jessica Dutton: Of May. I've forwarded the email to Jeanne to get subs changed

[3/2/20 3:35 PM] Judy Rehburg: I missed that email!

[3/2/20 3:36 PM] Leilani Green: Ugh... Time to replan my unit...

[3/2/20 3:36 PM] Addy Tang: Awww, sad Nicole. Dear goodness, this is unorganized but thankfully we can be gracious and flexible 

[3/2/20 3:40 PM] Nicole Aquino: Yes we can, it may actually be easier for me in May since I'm working on meiosis right now üò≥

[3/6/20 9:00 AM] Nicole Aquino: Judy.... I have a student in life science who did pretty well and he wants to take physiology... I really have been teaching them the living earth so he's done the current NGSS standards. What do you think?

[3/6/20 4:54 PM] Judy Rehburg: Anybody know where the lab coats are in the back? Nicole, I'll write you back later?

[3/9/20 4:50 PM] Kathryn Oberle: I never saw them!  

[3/9/20 5:23 PM] Nicole Aquino: They had a long discussion about how to make my room science friendly or where to put another science teacher, so I'm hoping that's a good sign for me 

[3/9/20 6:02 PM] Addy Tang: Oooo!!! That's great!!

[3/9/20 7:29 PM] Nicole Aquino: Yes but I'm trying to be realistic and until I know for sure, am not planning for anything yet for next year 

[3/12/20 9:14 AM] Nicole Aquino: The kids are saying a swimmer from Valencia that was here yesterday has tested positive for covid -19...... anyone heard this or can confirm it

[3/12/20 9:14 AM] Nicole Aquino: ??

[3/12/20 9:15 AM] Britney Brown: I heard Yoder is spreading this info and saying we're shutting down 

[3/12/20 9:15 AM] Britney Brown: From two periods now 

[3/12/20 9:16 AM] Nicole Aquino: Interesting.... one came and asked about graduation because he heard that it was cancelled. So the rumor mill is crazy.... I need more facts to counter this 

[3/12/20 9:17 AM] Britney Brown: Same I'm just saying it's something could happen but there's no decision right now so business as usually til Joey says 

[3/12/20 9:18 AM] Nicole Aquino: That's what I'm telling them also and showing them videos so they have accurate info 

[3/12/20 9:18 AM] Britney Brown: Same 

[3/12/20 9:20 AM] Jessica Dutton: I just showed this to Jeanne. He's with the drug dogs right now. 

[3/12/20 10:04 AM] Nicole Aquino: He sent out that email which was perfect timing. 

[3/12/20 10:05 AM] Nicole Aquino: I hope he brings the dogs here, I asked Matt to have them come to my third period at some point 

[3/12/20 2:41 PM] Jessica Dutton: Brit... are your guys still playing today? 

[3/12/20 2:43 PM] Britney Brown: Yes we're already here but this will be it üòï

[3/12/20 3:17 PM] Britney Brown: Yup same here 

[3/12/20 3:17 PM] Nicole Aquino: Will you give us the highlights after please? 

[3/12/20 3:18 PM] Jessica Dutton: I heard that!

[3/12/20 3:18 PM] Britney Brown: üòï

[3/12/20 3:18 PM] Britney Brown: Emphasized ‚ÄúWill you give us the highlights after please? ‚Äù

[3/12/20 3:18 PM] Nicole Aquino: Ok maybe lowlights would be better

[3/12/20 3:21 PM] Judy Rehburg: Yay! Keep us updated!

[3/12/20 4:15 PM] Britney Brown: So according to the email, there's a district team getting potential learning materials ready if we close, does that mean we wouldn't be online teaching?????  I'm not ok with potentially not getting paid üòï

[3/12/20 4:16 PM] Britney Brown: That's not what that means right? 

[3/12/20 4:17 PM] Addy Tang: Joey said that our pay would not be affected by this and that the discussions for what to IF we close are happening but nothing is set yet

[3/12/20 4:17 PM] Britney Brown: Liked ‚ÄúJoey said that our pay would not be affected by this and that the discussions for what to IF we close are happening but nothing is set yet‚Äù

[3/12/20 4:18 PM] Addy Tang: What to do IF we close because we're, as of yet, not going to shut down the school 

[3/12/20 4:18 PM] Addy Tang: The meeting didn't have too much else that we don't already know

[3/12/20 4:18 PM] Judy Rehburg: Anything yet?

[3/12/20 4:19 PM] Britney Brown: That's more than the email just said 

[3/12/20 4:21 PM] Addy Tang: That was probably the only thing new

[3/12/20 4:39 PM] Nicole Aquino: Liked ‚ÄúJoey said that our pay would not be affected by this and that the discussions for what to IF we close are happening but nothing is set yet‚Äù

[3/13/20 6:07 AM] Jeffery Hazard: Is there a new link to request a sub?  Mine just keeps spinning üò¢. I was planning on a test today but I was coughing too much last night so decided this morning I needed sub.  Please help, I will come in to get video setup for sub.

[3/13/20 6:09 AM] Nicole Aquino: Jeanne sent one a while ago that went into effect 3/1

[3/13/20 6:10 AM] Nicole Aquino: I just forwarded it to you

[3/13/20 6:10 AM] Nicole Aquino: Feel better and get some rest 

[3/13/20 6:10 AM] Jeffery Hazard: Ok , got it thanks

[3/13/20 6:11 AM] Nicole Aquino: You're welcome 

[3/13/20 7:54 AM] Judy Rehburg: Addy, Jeff doesn't have a sub and I'm taking over, can you split it with me? I need to finish writing a quiz!

[3/13/20 8:03 AM] Nicole Aquino: Just my kids are saying the sub said Jeff has the coroner virus..... can you clear it up with them 

[3/13/20 8:04 AM] Nicole Aquino: Judy****

[3/13/20 8:12 AM] Judy Rehburg: Addyyyyyyy! You out there?

[3/13/20 8:46 AM] Addy Tang: Oh dear! I left my phone in the car and just got it

[3/13/20 9:31 AM] Jeffery Hazard: Coroner virus!  That sounds worse than the corona virus!  I must say that I cannot confirm nor deny these rumors, but the odds are very small that I have it and I have not been to a doctor so I have not been tested even if there were tests available.

[3/13/20 11:15 AM] Nicole Aquino: Sorry Jeff.... I think it auto corrected üòÇ..... I hope you're ok, and figured it wasn't that, but needed the rumors stopped there

[3/13/20 12:47 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Email just sent - we are closed starting Monday!

[3/13/20 12:49 PM] Britney Brown: Yup

[3/13/20 12:55 PM] Nicole Aquino: Do I have to go? I'm already at parkview 

[3/13/20 12:55 PM] Nicole Aquino: To meeting I mean 

[3/13/20 12:55 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Can you let us know what was said?

[3/13/20 12:56 PM] Britney Brown: Prob not? Since you have to care of stuff there too

[3/13/20 1:08 PM] Nicole Aquino: Ok James is working on getting us info here, so I'll let you guys know what I'm told too. Please let me know what the meeting entails 

[3/13/20 3:03 PM] Britney Brown: You received a picture.

[3/13/20 3:03 PM] Britney Brown: Handout for meeting for Nicole and Jeff 

[3/13/20 3:06 PM] Britney Brown: Joey gave his number for stuff
714-497-7151

[3/13/20 3:16 PM] Britney Brown: Have rough outline of what you want kids to do while they're out and share it with Joey by end of Monday 

[3/13/20 3:22 PM] Britney Brown: Potential sign up form if you want to live stream to students 

[3/13/20 3:23 PM] Britney Brown: Potential day at office for parents/students to pick up packets if you don't want to do all online or have students who can't

[3/13/20 3:33 PM] Britney Brown: They're handing out chrome books to students who don't have them 

[3/13/20 3:33 PM] Britney Brown: Don't know when/where/how 

[3/13/20 3:33 PM] Addy Tang: They're also setting up hot spots

[3/13/20 6:13 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Did you all just see the email?  If a kid doesn't do the work we assign over break, it can't negatively impact their grade 

[3/13/20 6:13 PM] Stephanie Shirey: But we still have to assign it

[3/13/20 6:14 PM] Britney Brown: What?!

[3/13/20 6:14 PM] Britney Brown: Then wth are we doing it? 

[3/13/20 6:14 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Read your school email - there is a new one from Joey

[3/13/20 6:14 PM] Addy Tang: How can that be???

[3/13/20 6:15 PM] Nicole Aquino: My kids aren't gonna do it

[3/13/20 6:15 PM] Britney Brown: What's the point if we're just gonna let them do whatever 

[3/13/20 6:15 PM] Britney Brown: Mine won't if that's the case 

[3/13/20 6:15 PM] Addy Tang: Totally... üò°üò°üò°

[3/13/20 6:15 PM] Judy Rehburg: I think that if they don't do it online, then give it to them when they get back and if they don't do it, give THAT the zero!

[3/14/20 11:58 AM] Judy Rehburg: Anybody want to get together Monday at someone's house to teach each other how to use some of the software? I can teach Classroom if needed

[3/14/20 12:00 PM] Britney Brown: Yes üòÅ

[3/14/20 12:00 PM] Judy Rehburg: Cool! I want someone to show me the ins and outs of zoom

[3/14/20 12:01 PM] Stephanie Shirey: I'm up for that!  Also, maybe we can talk about our plan for assignments.  I refuse to do BS busywork for two weeks.  I still plan to teach a few things (less than normal except in AP).  Maybe we can have some consistency in our department in terms of levels - ie: college prep, Honors, AP.

[3/14/20 12:01 PM] Stephanie Shirey: We could also do a "practice" zoom with each other!  I'd like to try it once before the kids get involved 

[3/14/20 12:02 PM] Judy Rehburg: That's a great idea!

[3/14/20 12:03 PM] Nicole Aquino: I wouldn't mind meeting up there somewhere.... I have to come up and get my animals too 

[3/14/20 12:03 PM] Judy Rehburg: Yup! I should have a clean house by Monday!

[3/14/20 12:04 PM] Stephanie Shirey: 10 am works for me!  It would also be easier for us to meet so that we could collaborate with people who teach the same class.

[3/14/20 12:08 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Maybe we should just go to school?  

[3/14/20 12:08 PM] Stephanie Shirey: We have internet and space to work

[3/14/20 12:08 PM] Nicole Aquino: I do need to go there anyway 

[3/14/20 12:08 PM] Judy Rehburg: That's true. Only if we're on the couches, not in a room!

[3/14/20 12:09 PM] Stephanie Shirey: That's what I'm thinking - as much as I don't want to go to school - a lot of people were planning to go to school anyway 

[3/14/20 12:10 PM] Britney Brown: I'm down with going to school I gotta figure out the animal situation 

[3/14/20 12:10 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Okay - so, Judy, Nicole, Brit, Jess, Leilani Steph are all good-to-go for Monday at 10am.  Jeff, Addie, Zach, Kathy - does that work?

[3/14/20 12:10 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Maybe anyone who wants to do zoom can make sure we have an account before leaving Monday

[3/14/20 12:11 PM] Judy Rehburg: We can all hide out in other rooms to try out the zoom!

[3/14/20 12:12 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Liked ‚ÄúWe can all hide out in other rooms to try out the zoom!‚Äù

[3/14/20 12:12 PM] Britney Brown: Laughed at ‚ÄúWe can all hide out in other rooms to try out the zoom!‚Äù

[3/14/20 12:14 PM] Addy Tang: Can I join virtually? You'll definitely know if it works or not if you try zooming me in

[3/14/20 12:14 PM] Judy Rehburg: Yes!

[3/14/20 12:15 PM] Stephanie Shirey: That's fine!  Does bio have a plan?  I was just thinking that a lot of us had some ideas about what to assign then we got Joeys email.  We might need to tweak things a bit 

[3/14/20 12:16 PM] Judy Rehburg: I want to see how everybody is going to assign/grade things, and how they are going to deliver content

[3/14/20 12:16 PM] Stephanie Shirey: It would be best if science across the board had similar expectations I think.  

[3/14/20 12:17 PM] Judy Rehburg: Yup

[3/14/20 12:17 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Yeah - the fact that Joeys meeting said one thing and the email to parents said something else is really annoying 

[3/14/20 12:18 PM] Britney Brown: Emphasized ‚ÄúYeah - the fact that Joeys meeting said one thing and the email to parents said something else is really annoying ‚Äù

[3/14/20 12:18 PM] Addy Tang: Yeah, but I don't think he was withholding info but rather than he heard it from the top after our meeting 

[3/14/20 12:19 PM] Stephanie Shirey: I'm not saying he was withholding info.

[3/14/20 12:19 PM] Stephanie Shirey: I'm saying it's not right to tell us one thing and the parents something else.

[3/14/20 12:20 PM] Judy Rehburg: What did the parents say?

[3/14/20 12:20 PM] Stephanie Shirey: I mean the district, not Joey

[3/14/20 12:20 PM] Addy Tang: But it's not like he's talking from two sides of his mouth. It's not Joey's fault. He did send us an email prior to the parent email highlighting the change from our meeting

[3/14/20 12:20 PM] Stephanie Shirey: I'm not saying Joey at all

[3/14/20 12:20 PM] Addy Tang: Wait, did we get the parent email?

[3/14/20 12:21 PM] Britney Brown: I just find it irritating that we have to assign stuff but they don't really have to do it because it's "not meant to replace instruction" 

[3/14/20 12:21 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Liked ‚ÄúI just find it irritating that we have to assign stuff but they don't really have to do it because it's "not meant to replace instruction" ‚Äù

[3/14/20 12:21 PM] Britney Brown: What's it meant to be then???

[3/14/20 12:22 PM] Addy Tang: Yeah, that part was irritating for me too. That's what he told us changed from the district since our mandatory meeting. Was there anything else different between what we were told and what parents were told?

[3/14/20 12:23 PM] Stephanie Shirey: According to the quote Joey put in his email - which was quoted from the email the district sent to parents.   "Student grades should be held harmless. Any work assigned over the next hiatus should only augment a student‚Äôs grade not undermine it. The expectation is to provide lessons to maintain learning for students, not replace the rigor of daily face-to-face instruction."  

[3/14/20 12:24 PM] Judy Rehburg: Ugh

[3/14/20 12:24 PM] Addy Tang: Yup, he told us that in the email after the meeting. That sucks a lot but now that that's the situation, we have to make the best of it somehow

[3/14/20 12:24 PM] Stephanie Shirey: I talked to a couple people in social science who are still planning to assign stuff - just make it due quickly after we return just not immediately to try as a work around.  I refuse to waste my time - or my kids' time - with stupid stuff.

[3/14/20 12:24 PM] Britney Brown: I think they are seriously underestimating the kids' ability to stare at a screen all day

[3/14/20 12:25 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Laughed at ‚ÄúI think they are seriously underestimating the kids' ability to stare at a screen all day‚Äù

[3/14/20 12:25 PM] Addy Tang: Liked ‚ÄúI talked to a couple people in social science who are still planning to assign stuff - just make it due quickly after we return just not immediately to try as a work around.  I refuse to waste my time - or my kids' time - with stupid stuff.‚Äù

[3/14/20 12:26 PM] Judy Rehburg: Yup!

[3/14/20 12:26 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Well, anyone that can meet Monday we can talk about some ideas on how to assign stuff and still move forward, but not make it officially "points" from the two-week hiatus.  And practice zoom!!

[3/14/20 12:29 PM] Addy Tang: Sounds great! This is a tough situation for everyone but I know we can all get through this together üòä I really appreciate how we all want the best for our kids and are still continuing to strive to be the best educators we can even with these limits in place. Though what's happening is definitely not ideal in any way, I hope we can work together in unity to make it happen! 

[3/14/20 12:29 PM] Nicole Aquino: I know James said that they were sending out info so quickly and they did not have a plan, so things are changing

[3/14/20 12:37 PM] Judy Rehburg: Awe, Addy, you're so sweet!

[3/14/20 12:39 PM] Addy Tang: I was actually quite angry and frustrated yesterday but then realized that's not helping matters so I'm trying to think more positively because honestly it's been helping me face this mess with more hope

[3/14/20 12:42 PM] Nicole Aquino: Loved ‚ÄúI was actually quite angry and frustrated yesterday but then realized that's not helping matters so I'm trying to think more positively because honestly it's been helping me face this mess with more hope‚Äù

[3/14/20 12:42 PM] Judy Rehburg: My thought is, it is what it is. 

[3/14/20 12:46 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Yeah - I've accepted that we're going to do the best we can.  In AP it's business as usual (for the most part). For the rest, I'm just trying to navigate this whole "you must assign something but it can't officially count" thing.  I wish the district would have had teachers come in for a half day or whole day Monday to figure out several things (since it was so last minute on Friday).  Oh well.  It will be helpful if we can meet - I'm excited for our pretend video conference :-)

[3/14/20 2:02 PM] Jessica Dutton: I don't know what I'll be up to at 10 on Monday. I have to figure all 3 of my classes out and how to homeschool a 2nd grader. My thought is to test them on the info assigned the day after we get back and give a bonus if they can turn in at that time, but make it all due by the end of the week. 

[3/14/20 2:10 PM] Leilani Green: What time and where are we meeting Monday?

[3/14/20 2:11 PM] Addy Tang: Liked ‚ÄúI don't know what I'll be up to at 10 on Monday. I have to figure all 3 of my classes out and how to homeschool a 2nd grader.

[3/14/20 2:14 PM] Stephanie Shirey: 10am Monday.  700 building.  At least that seems to be consensus

[3/14/20 3:04 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Hi!  I'm happy to meet at 10am, at school, to practice Zoom and discuss a semi-unified game plan for online teaching/grading/Etc.  

[3/14/20 3:05 PM] Kathryn Oberle: I do plan to give new content to AP Bio.  And I want to with HBio, as well.  

[3/14/20 3:07 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Will be giving assignments in both classes.   Actually it's looking easier for AP Bio then it is for Honors.  

[3/14/20 3:10 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Glad people are still planning to give assignments!   Busy work that means nothing drives me nuts!  Totally get that different levels of kids while be more capable of learning on their own and more motivated to complete assignments.  Glad to see many of you on Monday!

[3/14/20 3:43 PM] Jessica Dutton: Just let me know what the official plan is. I don't want to drag Kira out there.

[3/14/20 4:57 PM] Judy Rehburg: The plan is Monday at 10 at school. If you don't want to come, we'll zoom you!

[3/14/20 4:58 PM] Jessica Dutton: Can't guarantee I'll be able to zoom...

[3/14/20 5:19 PM] Judy Rehburg: No problem. We'll update you on anything we learn!

[3/14/20 5:20 PM] Addy Tang: Loved ‚ÄúNo problem. We'll update you on anything we learn!‚Äù

[3/15/20 1:58 PM] Addy Tang: Loved an image

[3/15/20 5:11 PM] Stephanie Shirey: We just got an email from Candy Plahy with some clarifying directions about work.  The directions for elementary has more of the "hold harmless" language.  The directions for high school teacher is more  "communicate clearly" "be flexible with due dates" "realize some kids won't have internet until Wednesday when they pass out chromebooks".  It sounds like we are okay to give actual assignments.  That makes me feel better!

[3/15/20 5:14 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Someone else read her letter, please, and let me know if you see the language the same way.

[3/15/20 5:14 PM] Judy Rehburg: Yay!

[3/15/20 5:19 PM] Jessica Dutton: I still find it a little unclear about giving "new" material. But, as long as we give a more flexible due day (i.e. by the end of the week back), I think we should be fine. 

[3/15/20 5:22 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Liked ‚ÄúI still find it a little unclear about giving "new" material. But, as long as we give a more flexible due day (i.e. by the end of the week back), I think we should be fine. ‚Äù

[3/15/20 5:39 PM] Judy Rehburg: Hey, can you set a time limit on google form quizzes?

[3/15/20 6:02 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Hmmm...I kind of focused on last entry... make sure the parent does not have to worry that their child's grade is going to be hurt by closure...  that still implies grades do not count because if a student does not turn in work how would you be able to make that parent feel good when their kid just earned a zero?

[3/15/20 6:19 PM] Nicole Aquino: Judy.... yes and a due date, it's in the setting of the form

[3/15/20 6:23 PM] Judy Rehburg: I mean like a 60 minute limit once they open it 

[3/15/20 6:40 PM] Nicole Aquino: I believe so unless they changed it with that last update, I haven't used it since last year. I think you can also do a question time limit 

[3/16/20 9:54 AM] Nicole Aquino: I'm running a few mins behind 

[3/16/20 9:56 AM] Leilani Green: I'll be late. My cat was having issues this morning. I just left

[3/16/20 11:51 AM] Judy Rehburg: Internet is being stupid

[3/16/20 11:51 AM] Jessica Dutton: Me too. I thought it was because mine wanted to update

[3/16/20 11:51 AM] Addy Tang: O... I see

[3/16/20 11:51 AM] Judy Rehburg: Back on, check email

[3/16/20 11:51 AM] Addy Tang: Okay guys. Mom had an medical appointment today and we found out there were two deaths in OC

[3/16/20 11:51 AM] Addy Tang: I think I'm good on zoom, probably just need to collaborate with bio folk so I'll take it off the group chat

[3/16/20 3:29 PM] Judy Rehburg: Do the kids need zoom too, or by providing the link they click on will be enough?

[3/16/20 3:33 PM] Nicole Aquino: They need to dl it on their phone or computer 

[3/16/20 3:50 PM] Leilani Green: But they dont have to make an account. I still dont have one even tho i was in the call with u guys

[3/16/20 5:35 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Got my milk at store just now.  Good thing I drink non-fat!  No soup, eggs, bread, meat, etc.  crazy!!!

[3/16/20 6:43 PM] Leilani Green: Yikes! Oh no!

[3/16/20 7:52 PM] Kathryn Oberle: I'm coming into school tomorrow to do some recording, Lord willing.  Anyone else want to come by around 10am for moral support?  

[3/16/20 11:08 PM] Nicole Aquino: Anyone still up? I forgot to upload my doc and can't find the email with the link

[3/16/20 11:20 PM] Nicole Aquino: I found it finally

[3/17/20 12:43 PM] Addy Tang: Laughed at ‚ÄúYeah for sure.  Riverside county has first said 2 weeks, and just changed today to April 39‚Äù

[3/17/20 12:43 PM] Addy Tang: Yikes!

[3/17/20 12:52 PM] Nicole Aquino: I think at least the 13th for us

[3/17/20 1:13 PM] Jessica Dutton: You received a picture.

[3/17/20 1:13 PM] Jessica Dutton: Building a robot unicorn.

[3/17/20 1:15 PM] Nicole Aquino: ohhh where did you get that? Pipie would love it!

[3/17/20 1:15 PM] Nicole Aquino: I think we need to get them together at some point

[3/17/20 1:16 PM] Jessica Dutton: After social distancing! My mom got there unicorn on Amazon, but they have them at Target. 

[3/17/20 1:17 PM] Nicole Aquino: Yes! I will order her one. she said she wants one

[3/17/20 1:22 PM] Nicole Aquino: Is anyone doing a required amount of weekly checkins? or that a no no at this point? Trying to get mine somewhat accoutable

[3/17/20 1:23 PM] Britney Brown: I made everything for the week due by Sundays, that's about it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[3/17/20 1:26 PM] Nicole Aquino: Thanks

[3/17/20 1:26 PM] Nicole Aquino: OK

[3/17/20 1:31 PM] Stephanie Shirey: I'm having them submit work each Sunday

[3/17/20 1:32 PM] Nicole Aquino: I am going to do that also I think

[3/17/20 2:13 PM] Judy Rehburg: Just did a meeting with about 30 kids. It was fun! I miss them!

[3/17/20 2:15 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Did they need to download the app?

[3/17/20 2:16 PM] Stephanie Shirey: How did you write on the screen or did you just use your mouse?

[3/17/20 3:28 PM] Jessica Dutton: You received a picture.

[3/17/20 3:38 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Loved an image

[3/17/20 3:39 PM] Nicole Aquino: Loved an image

[3/17/20 3:40 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Okay my first attempt failed.  No sound.  Latest attempt on my new laptop - worked!  Praise God!  How many more of these videos do I need to do?  Way more if we're out for longer than 2 weeks!  

[3/17/20 3:43 PM] Nicole Aquino: Glad it worked. When I submitted my outline to him, he said to keep it simple with my population. It's sort of deflating that everyone expects so little of them, they are capable and some want to do it 

[3/17/20 3:44 PM] Nicole Aquino: Did you see that Kanas just closed all schools for the rest of the year?!?!?

[3/17/20 3:51 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Disliked ‚ÄúGlad it worked. When I submitted my outline to him, he said to keep it simple with my population. It's sort of deflating that everyone expects so little of them, they are capable and some want to do it ‚Äù

[3/17/20 3:51 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Yikes!

[3/17/20 3:51 PM] Stephanie Shirey: And I meant a thumbs down that we expect so little!

[3/17/20 3:57 PM] Nicole Aquino: Yes, so I will put up what I want done and support my kids to do it

[3/17/20 5:15 PM] Judy Rehburg: You received a picture.

[3/17/20 5:17 PM] Jeffery Hazard: This happens with google drive - it does not take too long to convert the video so google likes it

[3/17/20 5:17 PM] Britney Brown: Mine did that too but it still worked when I hit download 

[3/17/20 5:20 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Watching Newsome he said do not expect to come back before summer!

[3/17/20 5:20 PM] Jeffery Hazard: He said new guidelines have just come out

[3/17/20 5:21 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Also he is trying to get "tests" waived

[3/17/20 5:22 PM] Britney Brown: Emphasized ‚ÄúWatching Newsome he said do not expect to come back before summer!‚Äù

[3/17/20 5:23 PM] Addy Tang: Emphasized ‚ÄúWatching Newsome he said do not expect to come back before summer!‚Äù

[3/17/20 5:24 PM] Nicole Aquino: we plan to be out all year and distance teach

[3/17/20 5:24 PM] Britney Brown: Liked ‚Äúwe plan to be out all year and distance teach‚Äù

[3/17/20 5:27 PM] Nicole Aquino: CAN I TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I AM THAT I HAVE KIDS DOING WORK!!!!!

[3/17/20 5:28 PM] Britney Brown: Loved ‚ÄúCAN I TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I AM THAT I HAVE KIDS DOING WORK!!!!!‚Äù

[3/17/20 5:29 PM] Judy Rehburg: This is so depressing 

[3/17/20 5:30 PM] Addy Tang: Loved ‚ÄúCAN I TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I AM THAT I HAVE KIDS DOING WORK!!!!!‚Äù

[3/17/20 5:30 PM] Nicole Aquino: Honestly, I‚Äôd rather be safe then sorry though

[3/17/20 5:30 PM] Britney Brown: It's freakin crazy but yah safe than sorry 

[3/17/20 5:31 PM] Britney Brown: I mean if it happens I suppose we'll all get used to it, just it kinda sucks too üòï

[3/17/20 5:32 PM] Nicole Aquino: It does suck, but we'll get though it with our awesome dept!!! 

[3/17/20 5:44 PM] Britney Brown: You received a picture.

[3/17/20 5:44 PM] Britney Brown: That's what I found.... So seems like he said it but maybe it's just a guess? 

[3/17/20 6:08 PM] Stephanie Shirey: I don't think it's official yet...  but that seems to be the way things are trending across the nation!  üò¢

[3/17/20 6:10 PM] Me: Okay, I keep hearing that orange county just went full quarantine today. I can't find confirmation, y'all see anything?

[3/17/20 6:11 PM] Jessica Dutton: Bryan's still going to work tomorrow...

[3/17/20 6:12 PM] Nicole Aquino: On the news it just said certain "essential" employees are still required, but bars and clubs are all closed, anything that serves food should be pickup or delivery only.... they did not say full quarantine 

[3/17/20 6:39 PM] Judy Rehburg: I'm hosting a zoom with Apes at 1, I'll let you know how it goes!

[3/17/20 6:46 PM] Nicole Aquino: Good luck 

[3/17/20 7:51 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Club Pilates just closed for two weeks. My class tonight was the first cancelled. ü•∫.   We are basically on lockdown.  

[3/17/20 7:52 PM] Jessica Dutton: Mine did too. We get 30 days free online for both Club Pilates and Yoga Six.

[3/17/20 7:54 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Yep!  

[3/17/20 7:55 PM] Nicole Aquino: Crunch closed until the end of the month 

[3/17/20 7:56 PM] Kathryn Oberle: ZACH -  the Renaissance Faire has been cancelled!  You can submit your tix and they will issue you new ones for 2021.  Think they'll give two tix for each one returned.  

[3/17/20 7:56 PM] Me: üò¢

[3/17/20 7:57 PM] Kathryn Oberle: I'll mail them in for you if you'd like. 

[3/17/20 7:57 PM] Nicole Aquino: üòû

[3/17/20 8:45 PM] Judy Rehburg: I made videos on screencastomatic, saved them, but when I posted them, the kids can't see them. They see this. Any ideas?

[3/17/20 9:03 PM] Addy Tang: Loved ‚ÄúIt does suck, but we'll get though it with our awesome dept!!! ‚Äù

[3/17/20 9:05 PM] Addy Tang: Hmmm... did you share the files with them? I've had students try to open it via gClass but you have to click on the 3 dots and select download then when it downloads on the bottom of your browser, you should be able to view it if you open it with like Windows media player or an equivalent

[3/18/20 12:53 AM] Judy Rehburg: Steph, they just needed the link, no need to download. They even could use their phones. I'm going to make videos to watch, then open zoom for discussion and questions 

[3/18/20 7:27 AM] Britney Brown: Ummmm I'm not complaining but did the district just sign anyone else up for canvas? I got a welcome email this morning saying thanks for joining let's get started.... is this a hint about how long we're gonna be out? Or did I sign up in my sleep ?üòÇ

[3/18/20 7:31 AM] Nicole Aquino: I have not but it may take a while for us all to get them. Did you see Will's email about distance learning needs with science? They're prepping for us to be out 

[3/18/20 7:31 AM] Britney Brown: Yeh I saw that 

[3/18/20 7:32 AM] Nicole Aquino: My kids district is too, I'm going to get a chromebook for my little one because we each need a device and they're starting distance learning next week

[3/18/20 7:32 AM] Britney Brown: I mean I don't hate canvas I just thought it was odd that I didn't remember signing up üòÇ

[3/18/20 7:33 AM] Britney Brown: One of the few upsides to over priced private school, we already had a chrome book üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[3/18/20 7:36 AM] Nicole Aquino: Maybe they are signing us all up, when I used canvas before, it took them a while to get login info out to everyone and we were much smaller

[3/18/20 7:37 AM] Nicole Aquino: Laughed at ‚ÄúOne of the few upsides to over priced private school, we already had a chrome book üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚Äù

[3/18/20 7:38 AM] Nicole Aquino: She had one at school but they just need us to pick them up and didn't for them.... 2 devices for 3 of us didn't work so well yesterday 

[3/18/20 7:45 AM] Stephanie Shirey: I didn't get a welcome to canvas email - at least not yet!

[3/18/20 7:57 AM] Britney Brown: Ok maybe I was signing up for things in my sleep then

[3/18/20 9:04 AM] Jessica Dutton: You received a picture.

[3/18/20 9:04 AM] Jessica Dutton: Kira started distance learning today. Class meeting currently in progress. 

[3/18/20 9:06 AM] Nicole Aquino: Loved ‚ÄúKira started distance learning today. Class meeting currently in progress. ‚Äù

[3/18/20 9:07 AM] Jessica Dutton: They're using Google Meet... seems to work pretty well. 

[3/18/20 10:44 AM] Britney Brown: Ok so I made a quiz on google forms and some of them took it prematurely without doing the review stuff first üòë can I reopen it if I'm feeling nice?

[3/18/20 10:45 AM] Judy Rehburg: Ha ha! 

[3/18/20 10:46 AM] Britney Brown: I only care cuz it's one of my smart kids who actually wants to do the review stuff üòÇ

[3/18/20 10:49 AM] Judy Rehburg: There should be a button in settings that allows them to retake it

[3/18/20 10:50 AM] Britney Brown: Is it the 1 response button? I think I just fixed it 

[3/18/20 10:52 AM] Jessica Dutton: I'm recording my entire AP Physics into right now through PowerPoint... seems to be working well. My voice is getting tired! 

[3/18/20 10:52 AM] Jessica Dutton: Unit... not into

[3/18/20 10:53 AM] Britney Brown: I did that yesterday for honors it's weird cuz george and finn are home being quiet but listening to me talk to myself üòëüòÇ

[3/18/20 10:53 AM] Jessica Dutton: I have headphones on while Kira's quietly doing her math across the table from me! 

[3/18/20 10:55 AM] Jessica Dutton: And... Kira's done with ALL her schoolwork for the day. Scary! 

[3/18/20 10:56 AM] Britney Brown: Dude same, his teacher didn't assign very much üòï

[3/18/20 10:57 AM] Jessica Dutton: What am I supposed to do with her for the rest of the day? I have work to do! 

[3/18/20 11:09 AM] Stephanie Shirey: So I've been recording lessons and uploading them to google classroom / google drive.  I know there is a "processing time" before they will display, but my second video yesterday and nothing today will actually finish processing so the kids can see it.  It's never taken this long.  Has anyone else had this issue?

[3/18/20 11:11 AM] Britney Brown: Mine took a few minutes, maybe it's just cuz so many people are using it? 

[3/18/20 11:11 AM] Kathryn Oberle: Didn't get anything for Canvas. I'm saving my Zoom PowerPoints with voice overlay in my Dropbox, then making hyperlink for it on my class hyper doc.  

[3/18/20 11:12 AM] Kathryn Oberle: Haven't decided how I want to do live group chat yet.  Zoom?  Google hangout?  Any suggestions?

[3/18/20 11:12 AM] Stephanie Shirey: Hmmm - maybe I will do a dropbox.  How much space do you get?

[3/18/20 11:15 AM] Kathryn Oberle: Idk.  But it's easy to set up and use.  So far no negative feedback from students so they must be able to access the lectures. 

[3/18/20 11:20 AM] Nicole Aquino: Some of are confused on due.... even though it's right there on classroom ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm not going to do a lecture at this point, I don't spend a ton of time doing direct lecture anyway. 

[3/18/20 2:31 PM] Kathryn Oberle: There's a free version and you can pay for upgrades. 

[3/18/20 2:32 PM] Kathryn Oberle: I used the free version for years. When my home computer crashed I upgraded Dropbox to store all of my files. 

[3/18/20 2:34 PM] Stephanie Shirey: I uploaded to Dropbox for free and it worked for the kids to see right away, but I'm sure I will run out of free space fast!  But thanks for the suggestion.  I already paid for a tablet and some things for the I pad to make distance teaching work with problem solving... I hope google gets itself together soon cause I don't want to pay for more!

[3/18/20 2:42 PM] Britney Brown: Y'all read the email from plutko? Says we'll know by Friday if we have to extend our time away 

[3/18/20 2:43 PM] Nicole Aquino: I saw that

[3/18/20 2:44 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Yeah - I'm sure the schools districts were not thrilled with the governor speculating we will be out the rest of the year without telling them first!

[3/18/20 2:45 PM] Nicole Aquino: I agree and it‚Äôs going to be interesting whatever they decide I think

[3/18/20 3:07 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Can someone forward email ?  For some reason I did not get it üò¢

[3/18/20 3:39 PM] Nicole Aquino: saddleback USD just closed through 4/3, then we have break

[3/18/20 3:59 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Kathy - do you pay for DropBox subscription?

[3/18/20 7:38 PM] Me: Okay, I fought with a few video posting methods today; Google Drive took forever to process (still is actually) and Dropbox gave some kids trouble with accounts. 

Eventually, I decided to upload the video to my pylusd YouTube account through our staff email. Honestly, I think I might stick with this method going forward. Every kid can view it regardless of home tech and I can still control how public the video is. Just my two cents if y'all want to avoid paying for subscriptions.

[3/18/20 7:40 PM] Nicole Aquino: I like how we got a shout out from Joey earlier today too because we're awesome üòä

[3/18/20 7:42 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Okay - thanks!  I actually tried YouTube today (I used to have a private channel for dance team videos).  It wouldn't finish process the you tube video either!  But I may try that in the future.  My advice is to set your video to "unlisted".  "Private" has tons of troubles with permissions.

[3/18/20 7:45 PM] Me: True, processing still took a while. Mine got stuck at 0% for a long time and 95% for a long time. I just waited for ~10 minutes and it went through.

[3/18/20 7:49 PM] Kathryn Oberle: I've had no problems with access to links to Dropbox.  

[3/18/20 7:49 PM] Jeffery Hazard: It could be they have an exponential leap of videos they are processing and google is a little overwhelmed

[3/18/20 7:50 PM] Kathryn Oberle: The free version of Drop box held all of my school stuff so you should be good Steph!

[3/18/20 7:50 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Yeah I'm sure it is overwhelmed

[3/20/20 9:10 AM] Jessica Dutton: Reading it now. 

[3/20/20 9:10 AM] Jessica Dutton: Interesting. I teach it in a different order than AP recommended fir the end of the class. 

[3/20/20 9:11 AM] Kathryn Oberle: Did you cover the first 75%?

[3/20/20 9:12 AM] Kathryn Oberle: I have, but I still want to do some Ecology with AP Bio.  That's the 8th and final unit for us.  

[3/20/20 9:12 AM] Addy Tang: This is very interesting! They never said anything about AP Digital Portfolio so I wonder how that's going to go. I actually covered just about everything with my kids already (assuming they did their assignments for this week)

[3/20/20 9:12 AM] Jessica Dutton: Looks like I'll be fine. Not covering the stuff I'm on now

[3/20/20 9:12 AM] Jessica Dutton: Do we tell the students? 

[3/20/20 9:13 AM] Addy Tang: I would! Maybe do it over zoom

[3/20/20 9:14 AM] Kathryn Oberle: They can access the info themselves at College Board.  I'd refer them to that then follow up with Zoom live.  

[3/20/20 9:17 AM] Kathryn Oberle: Click on get AP updates - gives subject breakdown as to what is not covered on test 

[3/20/20 9:18 AM] Addy Tang: Oh dear, they cancelled the MC portion of our test and it's now only the digital portfolio stuff which we covered a bit but were supposed to complete in class. How's that for equity??

[3/20/20 9:21 AM] Stephanie Shirey: I wish they would give more than 45 minute test.  That's 30 questions for us, which means each question has a relatively large impact on their score.   Our normal test is twice that for MC plus FR.  I wish they would do a longer MC test.

[3/20/20 9:21 AM] Stephanie Shirey: I don't do the CB order.  There are still a few things that I will need to cover that's being tested.

[3/20/20 9:23 AM] Jessica Dutton: Agreed. We do 50 in 90 minutes, and the FRQ!

[3/20/20 9:24 AM] Jessica Dutton: 25 questions to determine their score seems intense. 

[3/20/20 10:21 AM] Stephanie Shirey: Yep!

[3/20/20 10:21 AM] Judy Rehburg: Ugh. This sucks big ones

[3/20/20 10:21 AM] Britney Brown: Holy geez guys were closed til the 24th 

[3/20/20 10:22 AM] Stephanie Shirey: Yes it does!

[3/20/20 10:22 AM] Jessica Dutton: You received a GIF.

[3/20/20 10:22 AM] Addy Tang: Emphasized ‚ÄúHoly geez guys were closed til the 24th ‚Äù

[3/20/20 10:23 AM] Jessica Dutton: This is crazy! 

[3/20/20 10:24 AM] Nicole Aquino: So now that we are closed that long, do grades on work we‚Äôve been doing count?

[3/20/20 10:27 AM] Britney Brown: I would guess yes? 

[3/20/20 10:30 AM] Nicole Aquino: Other teachers are talking about how unless we meet IEP/504 and ELL accommodations, we are in violation of the IDEA act, so districts are not making any work either for or against their grade

[3/20/20 10:42 AM] Jessica Dutton: Are they going to make us freeze as of last Friday? I have a bunch of AP students miss that test! 

[3/20/20 10:43 AM] Britney Brown: I had a couple too, I made a google version that they could take from home ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[3/20/20 10:43 AM] Addy Tang: Emphasized ‚ÄúOther teachers are talking about how unless we meet IEP/504 and ELL accommodations, we are in violation of the IDEA act, so districts are not making any work either for or against their grade‚Äù

[3/20/20 10:44 AM] Jessica Dutton: Little hard to do with an AP test...

[3/20/20 10:44 AM] Britney Brown: I've just been inputting stuff we already had done before we left so slight changes to grades but so far nothing new yet 

[3/20/20 10:44 AM] Britney Brown: Not the actual ap tho... colleges do online courses all the time ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[3/20/20 10:45 AM] Britney Brown: Probably something more advanced than google needed üòÇ colleges use canvas ? 

[3/20/20 10:45 AM] Nicole Aquino: I have to get stuff put in from last week, but after that, who knows.

[3/20/20 10:51 AM] Britney Brown: I mean, outside of having specific teachers/aides on hand in the moment, aren't most things we do remotely basically in compliance with iep/504 type stuff? They have extra time, they can use alternative resources, we're providing options, we're trying to do zoom to get face to face time. I'm not a sped teacher so I don't know everything exactly but am I far off? 

[3/20/20 11:05 AM] Jessica Dutton: Maybe...

[3/20/20 11:11 AM] Kathryn Oberle: I'm collecting some stuff from Honors and AP classes this weekend. Am grading very leniently.  Have to figure out a way to test.  Don't know what to do with kids who were absent so much that they're at a D or an F before we went on isolation.  Some kids turned in absent work but I have some who have almost all red boxes on Aeries. 

[3/20/20 11:43 AM] Nicole Aquino: I think with 504/IEP stuff, I should be mostly in compliance because I do all of those things anyway, but I do have a couple that have a 1:1, so that is going to be interesting. I also have several that have many red boxes, so I told them to make up what they can and send me pics of it

[3/20/20 11:59 AM] Addy Tang: Liked ‚ÄúI think with 504/IEP stuff, I should be mostly in compliance because I do all of those things anyway, but I do have a couple that have a 1:1, so that is going to be interesting. I also have several that have many red boxes, so I told them to make up what they can and send me pics of it‚Äù

[3/20/20 12:13 PM] Jessica Dutton: On the AP Physics board, they're saying the test is likely going to be all FRQ!

[3/20/20 12:14 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Yeah I just saw that on the AP chem board . I worry about the kids uploading free response answers without issues!

[3/20/20 12:16 PM] Jessica Dutton: There were a ton of issues when I was doing the FRQ progress checks at the beginning of the year. I switched to only giving the MC

[3/20/20 12:19 PM] Addy Tang: Emphasized ‚ÄúOn the AP Physics board, they're saying the test is likely going to be all FRQ!‚Äù

[3/20/20 12:53 PM] Jeffery Hazard: In google classroom, when you want them to submit a " picture " of the work they have completed- how do you do that?

[3/20/20 12:55 PM] Nicole Aquino: You need to create an assignment for them to turn it in on and then they can take a pic on their phone or whatever to upload it.

[3/20/20 12:56 PM] Jessica Dutton: There should be a function where they can attach a document or pic

[3/20/20 12:57 PM] Nicole Aquino: The have a section that says what‚Äôs due and they can click that and it brings them to a submit section

[3/20/20 12:58 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Maybe it would work if I had students in class?

[3/20/20 12:59 PM] Nicole Aquino: oh yeah, you have to connect your classes

[3/20/20 1:00 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Also is there a link to add once so I do not have to repeat every class for every assignment

[3/20/20 1:00 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Sorry, I do not use this much at all

[3/20/20 1:00 PM] Britney Brown: Yeh when you assign something there should be an option in the upper corner to choose what classes you want to assign to 

[3/20/20 1:00 PM] Nicole Aquino: just make sure you click each period you want to add. I add information for all three at once, but you have to click it every thing you post

[3/20/20 1:01 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Ok that will help

[3/20/20 1:02 PM] Nicole Aquino: Once you start figuring it out and use it a few times, it‚Äôs fairly easy. Also if you use actively learn or edpuzzle, you can link them to classroom and push assignments and grades back and forth between them

[3/20/20 1:02 PM] Nicole Aquino: do you want me to add you to my class so you can look at what i have done? since we have similar populations?

[3/20/20 1:03 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Yes thanks

[3/20/20 1:03 PM] Addy Tang: Liked ‚ÄúOnce you start figuring it out and use it a few times, it‚Äôs fairly easy. Also if you use actively learn or edpuzzle, you can link them to classroom and push assignments and grades back and forth between them‚Äù

[3/20/20 1:03 PM] Nicole Aquino: ok i sent you an invite

[3/20/20 1:04 PM] Jeffery Hazard: I use google sites, but Joey said he did not want kids dropping off work

[3/20/20 1:04 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Thanks

[3/20/20 1:04 PM] Nicole Aquino: no they don‚Äôt need to drop it off, they can upload everything. especially if you have them doing things on google platform, they all integrate really well

[3/20/20 1:05 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Hopefully this will solve the problem

[3/20/20 1:06 PM] Nicole Aquino: If you need more help, I can zoom with you after I am done with my drop in period at 3

[3/20/20 1:07 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Thanks

[3/20/20 1:07 PM] Nicole Aquino: you‚Äôre welcome

[3/20/20 1:07 PM] Jeffery Hazard: I need to experiment first so I can have good questions for you

[3/20/20 1:08 PM] Nicole Aquino: ok, let me know whenever you‚Äôre ready... i am here to help ‚ò∫Ô∏è

[3/20/20 1:08 PM] Jeffery Hazard: üòÅ

[3/20/20 1:25 PM] Me: Teamwork makes the dream work!!!

[3/20/20 1:25 PM] Nicole Aquino: Loved ‚ÄúTeamwork makes the dream work!!!‚Äù

[3/20/20 1:27 PM] Kathryn Oberle: So thankful for all of you!  

[3/20/20 1:48 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Ugggg - one of my students had a parent who's also a teacher who told her kid "don't worry about doing any of this work - they can't grade it anyway". Why would a parent - who's a teacher - not want her kid to do anything?!?

[3/20/20 1:48 PM] Me: At the honors/AP level no less.....

[3/20/20 1:48 PM] Jeffery Hazard: Ok, I have done that but how would they download back into classroom- under student work

[3/20/20 1:49 PM] Nicole Aquino: oh no!!!! I had my kids doing work I found for them on Tuesday-- the need to keep their brains sharp

[3/20/20 1:50 PM] Jessica Dutton: I made Kira do work Monday and Tuesday, before her teacher sent us materials

[3/20/20 1:50 PM] Britney Brown: There's a bunch of "comforting" memes going around insta that say stuff like that, don't worry about learning just take this time to be together as a family, school can wait...

[3/20/20 1:51 PM] Britney Brown: It's not the best way to think...

[3/20/20 1:51 PM] Addy Tang: Loved ‚ÄúTeamwork makes the dream work!!!‚Äù

[3/20/20 1:51 PM] Nicole Aquino: my girls don‚Äôt get work until next week officially, but Pipie‚Äôs teacher already uploaded it, and she‚Äôs done half of it already. Bridge doesn‚Äôt have anything up yet-- but she‚Äôs been doing my stuff I gave her

[3/20/20 1:51 PM] Addy Tang: Emphasized ‚ÄúUgggg - one of my students had a parent who's also a teacher who told her kid "don't worry about doing any of this work - they can't grade it anyway". Why would a parent - who's a teacher - not want her kid to do anything?!?‚Äù

[3/20/20 1:51 PM] Jessica Dutton: Don't worry about kids having too much screen time...

[3/20/20 1:51 PM] Stephanie Shirey: I would feel differently if students or their families were actively sick!!  

[3/20/20 1:51 PM] Jessica Dutton: Yep

[3/20/20 1:51 PM] Addy Tang: Emphasized ‚ÄúThere's a bunch of "comforting" memes going around insta that say stuff like that, don't worry about learning just take this time to be together as a family, school can wait...‚Äù

[3/20/20 1:51 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Sheesh!   

[3/20/20 1:52 PM] Nicole Aquino: It‚Äôs all about finding balance

[3/20/20 1:52 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Anyway, I just said I was flexible but I was grading the work in some form at some point  :-/

[3/20/20 1:53 PM] Addy Tang: Yikes üò≥ that's true. Balance is good. Kids who take this as free time without doing any school will suffer later. It's suffer now or later lol

[3/20/20 1:53 PM] Nicole Aquino: I had an email from a parent teacher the first day telling me how thankful she is for my putting up with her kid all year and she doesn‚Äôt know how I do it... he‚Äôs a pain but a good kid, very different from his siblings though. He‚Äôs doing the work, but driving her nuts

[3/20/20 1:53 PM] Jessica Dutton: Exactly. Either do it now a little at a time or play catch up later

[3/20/20 1:54 PM] Nicole Aquino: I had one student on zoom a little bit ago tell me how much he missed school and my class--- he‚Äôs happy he has stuff to do

[3/20/20 1:54 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Loved ‚ÄúI had one student on zoom a little bit ago tell me how much he missed school and my class--- he‚Äôs happy he has stuff to do‚Äù

[3/20/20 3:18 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Bobs bday is a week from Sunday.  A Zoom for him from all of us would be nice!  

[3/20/20 3:19 PM] Kathryn Oberle: And Brits bday is this Sunday, right?

[3/20/20 3:31 PM] Britney Brown:  Brits bday is April 27 üòÅüëç

[3/20/20 3:46 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Oops!  I wrote it in the wrong month!  Hah!

[3/20/20 3:47 PM] Kathryn Oberle: No I know what I did!  Can't read my own writing !!! ü§£ü§£ü§£.  It's Bil's bday!   

[3/20/20 4:03 PM] Jeffery Hazard: I think after 50, Bil stopped having birthdays!  That was traumatic enough...

[3/20/20 5:21 PM] Stephanie Shirey: So I've been trying to read the huge document on my phone.   Not very successfully.  We are not counting any work from 3/13 to 4/13 for grades?  What about after that?  What about tests?  Im not supposed to grade anything, but I'm supposed to make assignments?  Why would I make them, if they don't matter and if I'm not grading them?  I'm confused.

[3/20/20 5:29 PM] Jessica Dutton: That's what the wording seems like to me. 3rd quarter ends 3/13. 4th quarter begins 4/13.

[3/20/20 5:36 PM] Addy Tang: Yeah... it's word

[3/20/20 5:36 PM] Addy Tang: Weird *

[3/20/20 5:38 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Maybe I can just make one huge packet due for the first grade starting 4/13?

[3/20/20 5:38 PM] Jessica Dutton: There you go. Or, we just got a 4 week paid vacation? 

[3/20/20 5:48 PM] Nicole Aquino: Just wow 

[3/20/20 5:48 PM] Nicole Aquino: So when are 3rd quarter grades due

[3/20/20 6:03 PM] Stephanie Shirey: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[3/20/20 6:16 PM] Britney Brown: Nicole, do you use actively learn? You mentioned it and I'm checking it out it looks cool and I'm thinking about using it in the bio.... thoughts? 

[3/20/20 6:17 PM] Nicole Aquino: Yes I do and have assigned a lot... of links to classroom and will push assignments onto it and then grades into it

[3/20/20 6:17 PM] Nicole Aquino: I like it a lot, they have a lot of topics, simulations, videos, lexile levels 

[3/20/20 6:18 PM] Britney Brown: Ok so it connects to classroom then? I just don't want grades all over the place üòë

[3/20/20 6:18 PM] Britney Brown: Yeh it looks really cool and I wanna use it somehow 

[3/20/20 6:18 PM] Nicole Aquino: It connects.... you can have it auto grade, then you review and sync to classroom 

[3/20/20 6:19 PM] Britney Brown: Cool 

[3/20/20 6:19 PM] Nicole Aquino: I think it's a great resource 

[3/20/20 6:19 PM] Britney Brown: Alrighty I'm sure I'll have more questions eventually üòÇ

[3/20/20 6:21 PM] Nicole Aquino: Ok, let me know, I can help... I've been using it for a while. The biggest thing that is irritating is the kids don't always go in through classroom because I put all my links on a doc, and it wants a code. So I just posted the code for each class in a couple places

[3/20/20 6:21 PM] Britney Brown: Oh good to know 

[3/20/20 6:22 PM] Nicole Aquino: But you know my kids too... they don't read the doc that says read me first üòÇüòÇ

[3/20/20 6:22 PM] Nicole Aquino: Or they look at it and don't actually read what it says 

[3/20/20 6:22 PM] Britney Brown: Haha yeh üòÇ

[3/20/20 6:22 PM] Britney Brown: Mine too honestly 

[3/20/20 6:29 PM] Britney Brown: Ok so I'm looking at an article just to get a feel, whenever there's a question will the kids get a space to answer after I "assign"? I'm assuming yes? 

[3/20/20 6:29 PM] Nicole Aquino: Yes

[3/20/20 6:29 PM] Britney Brown: üëç

[3/20/20 6:29 PM] Nicole Aquino: You can even customize the questions, adjust dok, add questions.... basically whatever you want 

[3/20/20 6:30 PM] Britney Brown: Cool beans I like it 

[3/20/20 6:31 PM] Nicole Aquino: Good and the feedback from the kids here and at parkview has been good about it 

[3/20/20 6:34 PM] Addy Tang: Is Actively Learn something like Newsela??

[3/20/20 6:34 PM] Britney Brown: I feel like yes

[3/20/20 6:34 PM] Nicole Aquino: Sort of, but not necessarily daily articles and they have more than just articles 

[3/20/20 6:35 PM] Britney Brown: I used newsela a while ago so I don't remember everything 

[3/20/20 6:35 PM] Britney Brown: It's pretty cool I like it so far 

[3/20/20 6:35 PM] Nicole Aquino: I used to use newsela but I won't pay for it now, so actively learn is my choice 

[3/20/20 6:51 PM] Addy Tang: Is actively learn always free?

[3/20/20 6:53 PM] Nicole Aquino: I think so 

[3/20/20 7:02 PM] Addy Tang: Oh nice!

[3/20/20 7:05 PM] Britney Brown: Kathy
Just wanted to let you know, I zoomed today with my honors kids and  they said they loved the hhmi stuff, even asked if we could do more! I'm going to see about incorporating some more over the next few weeks, I'll let you know what I find üòÅüëç

[3/20/20 7:05 PM] Nicole Aquino: Some of the hhmi stuff has been incorporated into edpuzzle, so they don't need to print worksheets

[3/20/20 7:06 PM] Britney Brown: Weirdly I think they liked that part the most üòÇ I had them copy the doc and type their answers right on it in different colors to turn in 

[3/20/20 7:18 PM] Nicole Aquino: That's a good idea

[3/20/20 7:41 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Laughed at ‚ÄúI think after 50, Bil stopped having birthdays!  That was traumatic enough...‚Äù

[3/20/20 7:44 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Am Zooming Monday with my kiddos.  Can't wait!   I miss them all so much!!!!

[3/20/20 7:45 PM] Me: Honestly, it refreshed my soul to see my kids and teach again!

[3/20/20 7:55 PM] Addy Tang: Yay!

[3/20/20 8:28 PM] Judy Rehburg: I've never used hhmi. Is it a website? An app?

[3/20/20 8:30 PM] Nicole Aquino: It's the Howard Hughes medical institute site that they have tons of bio and chem stuff on there and they're aligned to NGSS 

[3/20/20 8:30 PM] Kathryn Oberle: They make tons of videos, have worksheets to accompany them, have virtual Labs, etc.  have shared some in the past.  Everything is free.  

[3/20/20 8:31 PM] Nicole Aquino: You need to sign up as an educator to access all the teacher resources 

[3/20/20 10:04 PM] Addy Tang: It's great! Love it a ton 

[3/20/20 10:34 PM] Judy Rehburg: All online?

[3/21/20 8:46 AM] Kathryn Oberle: Joey's driving me batty!  He had scheduled a Zoom DC meeting for Monday at 3.   I scheduled my classes for our first Zoom mtgs Monday at 11 am and 1 pm.   Gave myself time for bathroom breaks, stretching, etc.  I put them on the TWO calendars (you should really put your Zoom sessions on at least one of them!) that exist.  Today Joey moves the DC meeting to 1:30, right in the middle of my Honors Bio session (which he would have seen had he looked at a calendar).  After telling him he was adding stress, he decided to move it to 2 pm.  So now I have 2 straight hours of Zoom.  ARGH!

[3/21/20 8:46 AM] Kathryn Oberle: Sorry -- I needed to vent.  

[3/21/20 9:27 AM] Kathryn Oberle: Thankful he was willing to adjust.  Waiting for the updated DC invite.  

[3/21/20 9:35 AM] Nicole Aquino: That's really frustrating, maybe he should have had us put them on the google calendar like Joy suggested 

[3/21/20 9:45 AM] Kathryn Oberle: She made one.  That's one of the two calendars that exists.  

[3/21/20 9:46 AM] Nicole Aquino: I know, Joey told her we were using that doc instead. It would have been better if it was on the actual calendar.... so he can see it when he plans things üôÑ

[3/21/20 1:26 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Besides google calendar preferred for posting live sessions, anything else you want on the agenda?

[3/21/20 1:27 PM] Britney Brown: More clarification on the whole grades issue

[3/21/20 1:29 PM] Stephanie Shirey: Yes - because Joey's email said that we should teach essentials and start next week.  I'm planning to be flexible with due dates after we get back, but ultimately are the kids expected to do anything?  Otherwise I feel like all this effort I'm putting into online lessons are a waste of time.   ü§™

[3/21/20 1:30 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Got it!

[3/21/20 1:32 PM] Jessica Dutton: I agree! 

[3/21/20 1:33 PM] Jessica Dutton: You received a picture.

[3/21/20 1:33 PM] Jessica Dutton: Social distancing to the extreme!

[3/21/20 1:38 PM] Addy Tang: Yeah, I agree as well. I felt a bit confused after reading his email yesterday since it seems like he wants us to do something different than what we're already doing

[3/21/20 2:04 PM] Kathryn Oberle: It's on the agenda. üëç

[3/21/20 2:08 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Getting ideas for Settlers of Catan game variation, entitled "surviving quarantine" -- I'll trade you 2 cans of soup for 1 roll of tp!

[3/21/20 5:44 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Woohoo!  Problem solved!

[3/21/20 6:26 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Question:  on Zoom, how do you minimize your face?  Also, how do you see menu with annotate?  

[3/21/20 11:24 PM] Kathryn Oberle: Never mind, I figured it out.
